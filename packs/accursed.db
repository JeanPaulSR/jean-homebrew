magic expires. For each accursed, though, the affliction is permanent, a powerful magic that never fades. These curses can be received through many means: gaining the ire of a deity, a large coven of hags, or a powerful extraplanar entity; inheriting it by being born into a cursed family line; touching a cursed object; being hit by a volatile spell that was incorrectly cast; or receiving the curse from the bite or scratch of another cursed creature, among a slew of other possibilities.</p><h2>Curse’s Conqueror</h2><p>The vast majority of people who receive a permanent curse consign themselves to their fate, either finding a way to live with their curse’s adverse effects or giving themselves fully to the curse’s compulsions. A creature becomes an accursed by following a different path. Accurseds are rare, not due to lack of people becoming cursed, but because those who suffer these curses often lack the conviction to resist them.</p><p>An accursed dedicates their time and willpower to find a way to make the magic of their curse work for them, though each in their own way. Some accurseds experiment in a lab or scour the world for forgotten lore, trying to find a ritual or alchemical concoction. Others turn to nature or faith, using prayer, meditation, or mindfulness to synthesize the curse’s magic into their own being. And others still use sheer stubbornness to bend the curse to their will.</p><p>Regardless of method, an accursed is one who has conquered their curse, drawing on its magic while managing its lingering side effects.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"UAH","identifier":"accursed","levels":1,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"Hit Points","icon":"systems/dnd5e/icons/svg/hit-points.svg","_id":"XaYe5RIX002RGb0O"},{"_id":"fyYZFCzB95m5Nha7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.jean-homebrew.accursed.SCSk4nsWrKB2dGML","Compendium.jean-homebrew.accursed.OO126tlUUYZdY4TX"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"QqIJ3pNxkoBf70Oa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.jean-homebrew.accursed.diiGjf2wPSFG91zI","Compendium.jean-homebrew.accursed.10NgeErESLlLpGfo","Compendium.jean-homebrew.accursed.hWHDxIl3JQN2r1Nw"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"N5L4z5cLZ4K7q6aP","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.jean-homebrew.accursed.OlJizxp5lAFcMfZZ"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Features"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","dec","ins","itm","inv","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"int"}},"img":"icons/magic/death/undead-ghost-strike-white.webp","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"B0DJHUzhCGludWuM":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.3N7B8aYmgfX6x7O1"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674797979434,"modifiedTime":1674813475325,"lastModifiedBy":"B0DJHUzhCGludWuM"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"U78IYy4kkN3HDIpk"}
