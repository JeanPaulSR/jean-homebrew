Affliction</h2><p>Most curses used by mortals — such as the hex and bestow curse spells — are temporary, a simple inconvenience until the magic expires. For each accursed, though, the affliction is permanent, a powerful magic that never fades. These curses can be received through many means: gaining the ire of a deity, a large coven of hags, or a powerful extraplanar entity; inheriting it by being born into a cursed family line; touching a cursed object; being hit by a volatile spell that was incorrectly cast; or receiving the curse from the bite or scratch of another cursed creature, among a slew of other possibilities.</p><h2>Curse’s Conqueror</h2><p>The vast majority of people who receive a permanent curse consign themselves to their fate, either finding a way to live with their curse’s adverse effects or giving themselves fully to the curse’s compulsions. A creature becomes an accursed by following a different path. Accurseds are rare, not due to lack of people becoming cursed, but because those who suffer these curses often lack the conviction to resist them.</p><p>An accursed dedicates their time and willpower to find a way to make the magic of their curse work for them, though each in their own way. Some accurseds experiment in a lab or scour the world for forgotten lore, trying to find a ritual or alchemical concoction. Others turn to nature or faith, using prayer, meditation, or mindfulness to synthesize the curse’s magic into their own being.

While you can still be killed, you always return, and you will never grow older or lose your beauty. For the first few centuries, maybe even for the first few millennia, it was everything you ever dreamed of: no permanent consequences, no more living in fear of death, never having to worry about the seconds ticking away.</p><p>Eventually, though, you came to see immortality for what it truly is: a curse that ensures that there is never an end to your torment. No matter what happens, each dawn resets your physical form to its state at the moment you were cursed. You could do nothing but watch as everyone you ever cared about withered and died, you ran out of new things to discover and explore, and you began to grow apathetic and withdrawn as the world around you changed so much that you could no longer recognize or relate to it.

You determine the new body’s race using a process you discuss with your DM, or at the DM’s option you can roll on the table below (which is copied directly from the reincarnate spell). You then exchange your original racial traits for those of your new race.</p><p>Once you reach 20th level in this class, you finally attain enough control over your curse that you can break the endless cycle of rebirth.
