Whether sealed as a way of protecting the world or as a living weapon, the capabilities of these creatures are not to be undermined. A vessel acts as their living prison, but it might not always be this way. Vessels may be saints, their entity as a benefactor willingly assisting them as a mentor or guide as they grow together in harmony and bring about a better world together. Others may be corrupted by the forces they wield and succumb to the gnawing influence dwelling inside their hearts and minds. The nature of a vessel is to be a host for their entities and through their relationship, either mutually beneficial, corruptive, or simply parasitic, their proximity to power changes and emboldens them; mind, body, and soul. For this reason many are seen as untrustworthy or inhuman as they breach past the limits of what could be considered natural as magic augments their very being.</p><p></p><h2>Break and Bind</h2><p>Vessels have existed for thousands of years in many different forms. Whereas warlocks bind and ply their power from otherworldly patrons, and sorcerers wield the power lying within their own blood, vessels gain their magic through a more authoritative position: as a host.</p><p>Creating a vessel is no small feat and involves a long, difficult, and often deadly, ritual. Many times this process is seen more as a sacrifice to the entities rather than a successful sealing process. The rituals conducted to parcel out and seal the entity's power can be considered strange by some as the blood and soul of the vessel and the entity are intertwined.</p><p>The process can have many different forms as it often changes depending on the time, place, and culture of the sealers, and the entity being sealed. The most common process of sealing involves a literal mixing of both parties' blood after being anointed with sealing symbols and glyphs. Others are marked and fed to the entities, devoured whole only to emerge with the entity locked inside of them. Whatever the process may be, it often involves some of the most powerful and strange magic available.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"vessel","levels":1,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max"},"title":"Hit
